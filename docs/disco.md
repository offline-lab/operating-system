# Disco

Automatic service discovery and name resolution for offline networks.

## What it does

Disco solves a basic problem in an offline network: nodes need to find each other by name without DNS servers, without manual configuration, and without internet. When a Raspberry Pi boots in the field, other nodes should discover it and its services automatically.

The daemon broadcasts its identity (hostname, IP addresses, running services) over UDP. Every other node running disco receives these broadcasts and builds a local cache. Name resolution is wired into the operating system through a custom NSS module, so standard tools like `ssh`, `curl`, and `ping` resolve discovered hosts without any extra configuration.

## Why it exists

Offline Lab nodes run on a local WiFi network with no internet. There is no external DNS to resolve hostnames. Hardcoding IPs doesn't scale and breaks when nodes change. Disco fills this gap with zero-configuration service discovery designed for resource-constrained devices.

Design priorities:

- **Minimal footprint** - under 10 MB RAM, designed for Raspberry Pi Zero 2W
- **Zero configuration** - nodes discover each other on first broadcast
- **Native integration** - NSS module means standard tools work out of the box
- **Offline-first** - no dependencies on external services

## How it works

Each node runs `disco-daemon`, which does three things:

1. **Broadcast** - periodically sends a UDP packet (port 5354) with its hostname, IP addresses, and detected services
2. **Listen** - receives broadcasts from other nodes and maintains an in-memory cache
3. **Resolve** - answers name queries from the local NSS module over a Unix domain socket

Service detection is automatic. The daemon scans local TCP ports and maps them to service names (port 80 becomes `www`, port 25 becomes `smtp`, and so on). Discovered services are included in broadcasts so other nodes know what's running where.

```
Node A                          Node B
  |                               |
  |-- UDP broadcast (announce) -->|
  |   hostname: web1              |
  |   addresses: [10.0.0.1]      |
  |   services: {www: 80}        |
  |                               |
  |<-- UDP broadcast (announce) --|
  |        from Node B            |
  |                               |
  Both nodes update their caches
```

### Components

| Component | Description |
|---|---|
| disco-daemon | Go daemon. Handles broadcast, listening, service detection, name resolution. ~6 MB binary. |
| disco | CLI tool for querying and managing the daemon. Separate binary to avoid memory overhead in scripts. |
| libnss_disco.so.2 | C NSS module. Integrates with glibc so `gethostbyname()` and friends resolve discovered hosts. |
| disco-gps-broadcaster | Optional. Broadcasts GPS time for clock synchronization on airgapped networks. |

### Optional features

**DNS server.** Disco can serve DNS for the `.disco` domain, allowing standard DNS clients to resolve discovered hosts without the NSS module.

**Time synchronization.** On airgapped networks, NTP is unavailable. Disco can receive time from GPS broadcaster devices and synchronize the local clock. Requires at least two agreeing GPS sources before adjusting.

**Location sharing.** GPS broadcasters also share location data (coordinates, estimated country and timezone) via `LOCATION_ANNOUNCE` messages. All nodes maintain a location store with a 2-minute stale timeout. Location is always enabled when the daemon is running.

**Message signing.** Broadcasts can be signed with HMAC-SHA256 to prevent spoofing and replay attacks. Nodes verify signatures against a shared key before accepting announcements.

## Protocol

This section describes the wire protocol for anyone building a client implementation. Disco uses two transport channels: UDP broadcast for discovery and time synchronization, and Unix domain sockets for local name queries.

### Transport

| Channel | Address | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| UDP broadcast | 255.255.255.255:5354 (configurable) | Node announcements, time broadcasts, location broadcasts |
| Unix domain socket | /run/disco.sock (configurable) | Local name queries from NSS module |

All messages are JSON-encoded UTF-8. Each UDP datagram contains exactly one message. Unix socket messages are length-prefixed (4-byte big-endian length, then JSON body).

### Message types

#### ANNOUNCE

Sent by every node at a configurable interval (default 30 seconds). Contains the node's identity and services.

### NSS query protocol

The Unix domain socket uses a request-response pattern. Each query is a JSON object with a `type` field. The daemon responds with a JSON object.

#### Query by name

```json
{"type": "QUERY_BY_NAME", "name": "web1", "request_id": "query-123456"}
```

Response (success):

```json
{
  "type": "OK",
  "request_id": "query-123456",
  "name": "web1",
  "addrs": ["192.168.1.10"]
}
```

Response (not found):

```json
{"type": "NOTFOUND", "request_id": "query-123456"}
```

#### Query by address

```json
{"type": "QUERY_BY_ADDR", "addr": "192.168.1.10", "request_id": "query-789"}
```

Response format is the same as query by name.

#### List all hosts

```json
{"type": "LIST_HOSTS", "request_id": "list-1"}
```

Response:

```json
{
  "type": "OK",
  "request_id": "list-1",
  "hosts": [
    {
      "hostname": "web1",
      "addresses": ["192.168.1.10"],
      "status": "healthy",
      "services": {"www": "80"},
      "last_seen": 1708123456,
      "last_seen_ago": "2m",
      "is_static": false
    }
  ]
}
```

#### List all services

```json
{"type": "LIST_SERVICES", "request_id": "list-2"}
```

Response:

```json
{
  "type": "OK",
  "request_id": "list-2",
  "services": [
    {"name": "www", "protocol": "tcp", "port": 80, "hosts": ["web1"], "status": "healthy"}
  ]
}
```

#### Location status

```json
{"type": "LOCATION_STATUS", "request_id": "loc-1"}
```

Response:

```json
{
  "type": "OK",
  "request_id": "loc-1",
  "sources": [
    {
      "source_id": "gps-node-1",
      "latitude": 52.3676,
      "longitude": 4.9041,
      "altitude": 12.5,
      "fix": true,
      "satellites": 8,
      "estimated_country": "NL",
      "estimated_timezone": "Europe/Amsterdam",
      "last_seen_ago": "30s"
    }
  ],
  "count": 1
}
```

### Message signing

When security is enabled, messages include a `signature` object:

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| signature | string | Hex-encoded HMAC-SHA256 of `nonce + payload` |
| signer | string | Node ID of the signer |
| nonce | string | 32-character hex-encoded random nonce |
| timestamp | int64 | Unix seconds when the signature was created |

**Signing algorithm:**

1. Serialize the message fields (excluding `signature`) as deterministic JSON
2. Generate a random 16-byte nonce, hex-encode it
3. Compute HMAC-SHA256 over `nonce_bytes + message_json` using the shared secret
4. Hex-encode the HMAC digest as the signature

**Verification:**

1. Look up the shared secret for the signer's node ID
2. Reject if timestamp is older than 300 seconds or in the future
3. Recompute HMAC over `nonce_bytes + message_json` using the signer's shared secret
4. Compare using constant-time equality

### Rate limiting

Outgoing broadcasts are rate-limited with a token bucket algorithm: 10 messages per second, burst of 10. Incoming messages pass through a duplicate filter with a 5-minute TTL keyed on `message_id`. Duplicates are silently dropped.

### Host record lifecycle

1. A node receives an ANNOUNCE and creates a record with status `healthy`
2. The record's TTL counts down (default 3600 seconds)
3. If refreshed by a new broadcast, TTL resets
4. After TTL expires, status changes to `stale`
5. After a grace period (default 60 seconds), status changes to `lost`
6. Lost records are eventually removed from the cache

### Building a client

A minimal disco client needs to:

1. **Listen on UDP port 5354** for broadcast messages
2. **Parse JSON** datagrams and check the `type` field
3. **Deduplicate** by `message_id` to avoid processing the same announcement twice
4. **Extract host information** from `hostname`, `ips`, and `services` fields
5. **Cache records** with a TTL from the `ttl` field
6. **Periodically announce** its own identity using the ANNOUNCE format

Pseudo-code for a listener:

```
socket = bind_udp("0.0.0.0:5354")
seen_ids = cache_with_ttl(5 minutes)

loop:
    data = socket.recv()
    msg = json_decode(data)

    if msg.message_id in seen_ids:
        continue
    seen_ids.add(msg.message_id)

    if msg.type == "ANNOUNCE":
        store_record(msg.hostname, msg.ips, msg.services, msg.ttl)
    elif msg.type == "TIME_ANNOUNCE":
        handle_time(msg.timestamp, msg.source_id, msg.clock_info)
    elif msg.type == "LOCATION_ANNOUNCE":
        store_location(msg.source_id, msg.location, msg.estimated_country, msg.estimated_timezone)
```

Pseudo-code for announcing:

```
socket = create_udp_socket()
interval = 30 seconds

loop every interval:
    msg = {
        type: "ANNOUNCE",
        message_id: hostname + "-" + current_time_nanoseconds,
        timestamp: current_time_seconds,
        hostname: my_hostname,
        ips: my_ip_addresses,
        services: my_detected_services,
        ttl: 3600
    }
    data = json_encode(msg)
    socket.send_to(data, "255.255.255.255:5354")
```

For querying the daemon locally:

```
socket = connect_unix("/run/disco.sock")

query = {
    type: "QUERY_BY_NAME",
    name: "web1",
    request_id: random_id()
}

send_length_prefixed(socket, json_encode(query))
response = recv_length_prefixed(socket)
result = json_decode(response)

if result.type == "OK":
    return result.addrs
else:
    return not_found
```

## Configuration

Disco is configured via YAML. Minimal config:

```yaml
daemon:
  socket_path: /run/disco.sock
  broadcast_interval: 30s
  record_ttl: 3600s

network:
  broadcast_addr: 255.255.255.255:5354
  max_broadcast_rate: 10

discovery:
  enabled: true
  detect_services: true

security:
  enabled: false
```

Service port mapping is configurable:

```yaml
discovery:
  service_port_mapping:
    www: [80, 443]
    smtp: [25, 587]
    mail: [143, 993]
    ssh: [22]
```

The daemon detects services by attempting a TCP connection to each mapped port on `127.0.0.1`. Open ports are matched to service names and included in announcements.

## CLI reference

```bash
disco hosts                     # List all discovered hosts
disco hosts <name>              # Show host details
disco hosts forget <name>       # Remove host from cache
disco hosts mark-lost <name>    # Mark host as lost
disco services                  # List all services
disco services <name>           # Show service details
disco lookup <name>             # Resolve hostname to IP
disco status                    # Daemon status
disco time                      # Time sync status
disco timeset                   # Force time update
disco ping <hostname>           # Ping a discovered host
disco check                     # Check which services are reachable
disco announce                  # Send manual announcement
disco key generate              # Generate security keys
```

## Reference implementation

The reference implementation is written in Go and available at [github.com/offline-lab/disco](https://github.com/offline-lab/disco). It includes:

- `disco-daemon` - the core daemon (~6 MB binary)
- `disco` - CLI management tool (~4 MB binary)
- `libnss_disco.so.2` - C NSS module for glibc integration
- `disco-gps-broadcaster` - GPS time source for Raspberry Pi, Arduino, and ESP32

The NSS module requires Linux with glibc. The daemon and CLI work on any platform Go supports, but broadcast discovery requires UDP broadcast support.
