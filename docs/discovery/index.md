# Discovery

Automatic service discovery and name resolution for offline networks.

## What it does

Disco solves a basic problem in an offline network: nodes need to find each other by name without DNS servers, without manual configuration, and without internet. When a Raspberry Pi boots in the field, other nodes should discover it and its services automatically.

The daemon broadcasts its identity (hostname, IP addresses, running services) over UDP. Every other node running disco receives these broadcasts and builds a local cache. Name resolution is wired into the operating system through a custom NSS module, so standard tools like `ssh`, `curl`, and `ping` resolve discovered hosts without any extra configuration.

## Why it exists

Offline Lab nodes run on a local WiFi network with no internet. There is no external DNS to resolve hostnames. Hardcoding IPs doesn't scale and breaks when nodes change. Disco fills this gap with zero-configuration service discovery designed for resource-constrained devices.

Design priorities:

- **Minimal footprint** - under 10 MB RAM, designed for Raspberry Pi Zero 2W
- **Zero configuration** - nodes discover each other on first broadcast
- **Native integration** - NSS module means standard tools work out of the box
- **Offline-first** - no dependencies on external services

## How it works

Each node runs `disco-daemon`, which does three things:

1. **Broadcast** - periodically sends a UDP packet (port 5354) with its hostname, IP addresses, and detected services
2. **Listen** - receives broadcasts from other nodes and maintains an in-memory cache
3. **Resolve** - answers name queries from the local NSS module over a Unix domain socket

Service detection is automatic. The daemon scans local TCP ports and maps them to service names (port 80 becomes `www`, port 25 becomes `smtp`, and so on). Discovered services are included in broadcasts so other nodes know what's running where.

```
Node A                          Node B
  |                               |
  |-- UDP broadcast (announce) -->|
  |   hostname: web1              |
  |   addresses: [10.0.0.1]      |
  |   services: {www: 80}        |
  |                               |
  |<-- UDP broadcast (announce) --|
  |        from Node B            |
  |                               |
  Both nodes update their caches
```

### Components

| Component | Description |
|---|---|
| disco-daemon | Go daemon. Handles broadcast, listening, service detection, name resolution. ~6 MB binary. |
| disco | CLI tool for querying and managing the daemon. Separate binary to avoid memory overhead in scripts. |
| libnss_disco.so.2 | C NSS module. Integrates with glibc so `gethostbyname()` and friends resolve discovered hosts. |
| disco-gps-broadcaster | Optional. Broadcasts GPS time for clock synchronization on airgapped networks. |

### Optional features

**DNS server.** Disco can serve DNS for the `.disco` domain, allowing standard DNS clients to resolve discovered hosts without the NSS module.

**Time synchronization.** On airgapped networks, NTP is unavailable. Disco can receive time from GPS broadcaster devices and synchronize the local clock. Requires at least two agreeing GPS sources before adjusting.

**Location sharing.** GPS broadcasters also share location data (coordinates, estimated country and timezone) via `LOCATION_ANNOUNCE` messages. All nodes maintain a location store with a 2-minute stale timeout. Location is always enabled when the daemon is running.

**Message signing.** Broadcasts can be signed with HMAC-SHA256 to prevent spoofing and replay attacks. Nodes verify signatures against a shared key before accepting announcements.
