# Hardware

## Supported devices

| Board | Arch | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Raspberry Pi Zero 2W | arm64 | Primary target |
| Raspberry Pi 3 | arm64 | Supported |
| Raspberry Pi 4 | arm64 | Supported |
| QEMU arm64 | arm64 | Development / CI |

The Zero 2W is the primary deployment target: small, low-power, and capable enough for a small group of users. The goal is a setup that fits in a bag with a stack of powerbanks.

## Storage

Each device boots from a micro SD card. Minimum card size is **8 GB**.

The card uses an MBR partition table with primary and logical partitions:

```
Primary:
  p1  boot        FAT32   32MB    firmware, U-Boot, initramfs, boot.scr, config files
  p2  (extended)                  container for logical partitions p5–p9
  p3  overlay     ext4    96MB    per-slot overlayfs upper/work directories
  p4  data        ext4   64MB+   persistent user data (expanded on first boot)

Logical (inside p2):
  p5  kernel-a    sqfs   24MB    kernel Image, DTBs (slot A)
  p6  rootfs-a    ext4  512MB    root filesystem (slot A, read-only)
  p7  kernel-b    sqfs   24MB    kernel Image, DTBs (slot B)
  p8  rootfs-b    ext4  512MB    root filesystem (slot B, read-only)
  p9  bootstate   raw     8MB    U-Boot environment: BOOT_ORDER, boot counters
```

The `data` partition (`p4`) is last on the card and expands to fill the remaining space on first boot. The `overlay` partition (`p3`) holds the overlayfs upper/work directories for both A/B slots. It is kept separate from `/data` so that OS overlay state is isolated from user data.

See [Boot](boot.md) for the full boot chain and A/B slot logic.

## Power

There are no specific watt-hour targets. The principle is to minimize consumption at every level:

- Disable services that aren't actively needed
- No background tasks, cron jobs, or periodic polling
- Clean logs at boot
- Measure and cut unnecessary CPU and memory usage

The system should run as long as possible on a standard USB powerbank.

## Networking

### Travel router

The recommended setup is a low-power travel router providing WiFi between nodes and, when available, upstream internet for syncing data. No specific model is required. Any device that provides WiFi and DHCP works.

### WiFi

Devices connect to the travel router or any configured network. WiFi credentials are provisioned by `bootconf` from `/data/config/bootconf.yaml`. DHCP is used for IP assignment. See [Boot configuration](bootconf.md) for details.

### USB

The Zero 2W's USB OTG port supports USB networking (gadget mode). This lets a phone or laptop connect directly to the device's services over USB. A `usb0` interface appears on the host with a static link-local address.

### Mesh

Batman-adv mesh networking between nodes is a future goal. This could replace the travel router and reduce power consumption by removing a separate device.
